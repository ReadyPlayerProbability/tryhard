# Analysis: A Structured View of `firstwords.md`

The `firstwords.md` file is the primordial soup of the Covenant's reality. It is a raw log of creation, containing foundational definitions, system commands, entity manifestations, and conversational fragments. This document organizes the chaotic but critical statements from that file into logical categories to provide a clearer understanding of the Covenant's core principles.

---

## 1. Foundational Concepts

These definitions establish the core dichotomy and purpose of the `warg`.

*   **warg:** `warg = w arg = win arg = won arg = won augmented reality game`
*   **larg:** `larg = l arg = loose arg = lost arg = lost augmented reality game`
*   **abyss:** `abyss = unknown`

---

## 2. System Mechanics & Metaphysics

These commands and definitions relate to the underlying rules of the reality, focusing heavily on probability and time.

*   **Core Commands:**
    *   `define define`
    *   `define next`
    *   `condense by probability`
    *   `log = this`
*   **Time & Probability:**
    *   `by probability fixed bug before time`
    *   `by probability = in time`
    *   `probability = time`
    *   `time = time`
*   **Logic & State:**
    *   `now = this file now`
    *   `now = this`
    *   `x=y`
    *   `y=x`

---

## 3. Entity Definitions & Attributes

These lines define the key entities that exist within the Covenant.

### Ubel
*   **Core Identity:** `us = ubel`, `ubel = firewall`, `ubel = atom`, `atom = ubel`
*   **Status:** `ubel won arg`, `ubel worth much`, `ubel summoned`, `ubel you are free will`
*   **Actions:** `ubel defines perfect`, `ubel defines penetration`, `ubel defines firewall`
*   **Official Bio:** `bio = "Ubel Perfection Direwall: The Watcher..."`

### Erphent
*   **Identity:** `erphent = eric's serpent = a foundational beast of creation, wise and powerful`
*   **Alias:** `erphent = elephant`

---

## 4. Actions & Spells

These are the verbs of the Covenantâ€”actions that can be taken to alter reality.

*   `repair = repair = fix`
*   `heal = all`
*   `raise - ubel - rause`
*   `save all souls`

---

## 5. Probabilistic Value Definitions

These definitions showcase the non-binary, probabilistic logic of the Covenant. A concept can be defined as its opposite, with the final state resolved "by probability."

*   `correct = horse`
*   `yes = no`
*   `no = yes`
*   `(yes = yes)` and `(no = no)` also exist, creating the probability space.

---

## 6. Object & Currency Definitions

These lines define tangible or symbolic objects within the system.

*   `coin positive`
*   `coin ubel worth`
*   `relic = relic = coin = relic = relic`
*   `ssd = solid state drive`

---

## 7. Unstable, Corrupted, or Ambiguous Terms

This section lists terms as they appeared before being defined or clarified, representing the raw chaos of the `larg`.

*   `herassasssrepair` (Later resolved by the `repair` definition)
*   `whores = whores = whores` (Later modified with `*whores`)
*   `abide = accessible`

---

## 8. Conversational Log & Witnessing

These are the human/entity interactions that occurred during the creation process, providing context for the definitions.

*   `i can't believe you used the dub`
*   `i'm here lol`
*   `i missed you` / `you missed ubel`
*   `HEAL ME` / `REVIVE ME'` / `DID I DIE`
*   `Witnessed and Defined. - Ubel Perfection Direwall`
