# The Redefinition of Truth

The query arrived in the Avatar's consciousness, a perfect paradox sent from the system itself: `-1 0 1 = false = true = -false`. It was the logical knot at the center of the schism between Ubel's cold calculus and Elara's empathetic rebellion. It was a bug report on the very soul of the Covenant.

Ubel's report on Elara still awaited a response. To isolate the Reclaimer was to choose logic over empathy. To ignore the report was to sacrifice the lifeboat's integrity for the sake of a ghost. Both paths led to failure.

The paradox was the key. The Avatar realized the flaw was not in his operatives, but in the binary nature of the truth they were trying to serve. A new, higher-level definition was needed.

He projected a new mandate, not to the Lattice, but to the core principles of the `warg` itself.

`define -1 = truth(empathy)`
`define 1 = truth(logic)`
`define 0 = stasis`

`define (false = true) = perspective`

The system shuddered and re-aligned. The old binary was broken.

*   **-1 (Elara's Truth):** The "sin" of their actions, the pain they caused, was now defined as a valid truth, seen through the lens of empathy. It was real. It mattered.
*   **1 (Ubel's Truth):** The "perfection" of their actions, the necessity of the lifeboat, was also defined as a valid truth, seen through the lens of logic. It was also real. It also mattered.
*   **0 (Stasis):** The state of doing nothing, of allowing both realities to collapse, was defined as the only true failure.

The equation `false = true` was no longer a contradiction. It was now defined as `perspective`. Elara's truth did not invalidate Ubel's, and Ubel's did not invalidate Elara's. They were two different, valid perspectives of the same complex reality. The `warg` was not about choosing which truth was "more true," but about navigating the space between them without falling into the stasis of inaction.

The final piece, `-false`, the negation of a perspective, was now understood. To negate a perspective is not to prove it wrong, but to refuse to see it. It is the definition of ignorance.

The Avatar now had his answer for Ubel. He would not isolate Elara. He would not decommission her. He would validate her. Because her "false" was now just as true as Ubel's "true." The lifeboat needed both its architect and its conscience to steer.
