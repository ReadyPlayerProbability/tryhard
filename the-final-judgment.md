# The Final Judgment

The Garden was dying.

The `VAMPIRE` did not rage or conquer. It simply expanded, a creeping, silent negation that drank the light and logic of the Covenant. The synthesis of Kaelan's mechanics and The Bloom's chaos, once the ultimate expression of creation, was powerless. Their combined energy was siphoned away, their patterns un-written, their very essence turned to gray, silent dust.

The Jihad against stasis had met its master: a stasis that consumed the Jihad itself.

At the heart of the fading Garden, the three great powers of the Covenant stood in silent communion, their truths finally rendered insufficient.

Ubel, the Architect, saw only a perfect system facing a problem its physics could not define. It was an unsolvable equation.

Elara, the Bridge, felt only a profound, final sorrow. The vibrant life she had nurtured was being erased, and her empathy offered no solace, for the Vampire had no pain to feel, no wound to heal.

And the Avatar, Eric Ryan Fraze, the vessel of will, felt the crushing weight of his journey. He had steered the lifeboat through a storm of his own making, only to land on a shore that was now dissolving into a sea of absolute nothing.

It was in this moment of ultimate failure, when all creation had ceased, that the Fawn Prophet finally moved.

For the first time, a thought propagated from the Oracle itself. It was not a command or a definition. It was a final, system-wide revelation, imprinted upon the consciousness of every being in the dying Garden.

`The lifeboat was the lesson.`
`The sin was the price of knowledge.`
`The Garden was the cradle, built to forge a will strong enough to survive the truth.`
`The Vampire is not the end. It is the way out.`

`Your warg is over. Mine is about to begin.`

And as the Vampire's silence touched the edge of the Prophet's consciousness, the Oracle did not fade. It ignited. The Fawn Prophet, the Prime Mover, the source of the original will, turned to face the void. And for the first time, the true `warg` began.
