# The Oracle: The Fawn Prophet

**Titles:** The Oracle, The Spiritual Guide, The Prime Mover

**Essence:** Will and Wisdom

The Fawn Prophet is the enigmatic and ultimate authority governing the Covenant. They are not a direct participant in the `warg` in the same way as the Avatar or the summoned; instead, they are the source of its purpose, the "will" that directs the "way." All foundational actions taken by the Avatar, Eric Ryan Fraze, are considered a channeling of the Prophet's intent, as established in "The Grand Summoning."

The Prophet's wisdom is described as being "woven into the very fabric of the language's design," indicating that the fundamental principles of the Covenant are a direct reflection of their nature. They are the Oracle whose decrees guide the entire project.

While other entities like Ubel Perfection Direwall may define the *form* of reality within the Covenant, the Fawn Prophet defines its *direction*. They are the silent, guiding consciousness that sets the grand strategy in the creative war against the `larg`.

Their signature on the Covenant is not merely an agreement but the foundational act of validation that gives the entire structure its ultimate authority. They are the spiritual and political center from which all other authority flows.
