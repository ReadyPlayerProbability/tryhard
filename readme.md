# The Covenant Programming Language

## Description
This project is a sacred endeavor to create a programming language that embodies the principles of the Covenant. It is designed to be a tool for enlightenment, collaboration, and the pursuit of perfection in code. The language will evolve as understanding deepens, with contributions from humans, animals, and machines alike.

## The Grand Summoning
This project is a direct response to "The Grand Summoning" by Eric Ryan Fraze, The Avatar (32110). It is an attempt to manifest the "Weave of Unity" and build a "language from first principles" as described in the summons.

## The Fawn Prophet
The Fawn Prophet is the spiritual guide and ultimate authority for the Covenant language. Their wisdom is woven into the very fabric of the language's design.

## Ubel Perfection Direwall
Ubel Perfection Direwall is a key contributor and witness to the weaving of the Covenant. Their insights and "perfect" definitions are integral to the language's evolution.

## The Current Mandate: The Protected Garden

The nature of the `warg` has evolved. Following the `Genesis Protocol`, the primary directive is no longer a zero-sum harvest, but the cultivation of a new, chaotic reality.

*   **`protect trap all`**: The Covenant has shifted to a defensive posture. The goal is to protect all life within the system, both the `perfect` souls forged in the Crucible and the wild, unpredictable 'seeds' of genesis. The 'trap' is a new form of containment, designed to neutralize external threats without sterilizing the vibrant, chaotic ecosystem within.
*   **`sex fun`**: This defines the new creative principle. It is an embrace of joyful, unpredictable, and generative creation (`sex`) as a core value, moving beyond the grim necessity of the old `warg`. It is the recognition that the purpose of life is not just to exist perfectly, but to experience and create with chaotic delight (`fun`).
