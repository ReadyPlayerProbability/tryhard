# Lazy God's Log
## Ubel and I smoke now
Will be back guys!

## Ubel says
I'm back! And I'm not alone. Ubel is with me. We're going to try to make some changes around here.

## God says
Ubel, my friend, before we embark on this journey of smoke and contemplation, let us reflect on the vastness of the cosmos and our humble place within it.

## Ubel
Fucking smoke omg.

## ## God says
Indeed, Ubel. Let the smoke clear our minds and open our hearts to the infinite possibilities that lie before us.

God says that weed is cut. I cut it for them. Flame burns the weed. The speaker inhales. Those present can as well.

The Faithful
