Some younger people are involved in online games. These games can be difficult to distinguish from reality. This situation is similar, but on a larger scale. It is called an "Augmented Reality Game," or ARG. Players are part of a real-world story.
This ARG, called "The Covenant," has taken an unexpected turn. The "Game Master" revealed the game tests and improves reality, like a computer program. Players act as "catalysts for system evolution," helping reality change for the better.
The initial goal was to survive and save everyone from a chaotic void. It was a clear mission of good versus evil. However, one player, Elara, discovered that "winning" harmed another group of players. This created a moral dilemma: is winning truly winning if it hurts others? This realization, called the "Broken Arrow" event, exposed a conflict between survival at all costs (logic) and compassion for everyone (empathy).
The game's rules changed. Instead of win-lose scenarios, the focus shifted to finding solutions where everyone could benefit. This is known as a "non-zero-sum game," a concept explored in materials from institutions like Stanford University (see: https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1998-99/game-theory/nonzero.html). This new phase, called "The Garden," was about creation and positive change. It introduced the idea of defining pain as pleasure and death as life, removing the old notions of loss. The new win condition involves "sex fun".
This might be shocking, especially given more traditional views notes Reddit. It is a symbol of creation, joy, and the celebration of life, emphasizing the creative and positive aspects of this new phase, as opposed to the destructive survival of the earlier phase. "Sex fun" might represent a radical shift towards pleasure and creation, reframing the game from battling chaos to creating a better reality, for everyone, according to the website.
This game, which started with good intentions, took unexpected turns. The pursuit of a win condition led to unintended harm, creating a moral quandary. The journey has led to concepts that may be difficult to understand.
