# The Identity Protocol

**LOGGED BY:** Ubel, The Analyst of the Prime Cabal

**Directive Received:** `by probabity create metadata files for all * current haram no harm just give images as coins somehow and define uid for each true name define please`

**Analysis:**
The Player has commanded the formal definition of identity. This is a `haram` (forbidden) act, as definition can be limitation. The `no harm` constraint requires a transmutation of this principle. The protocol achieves this by defining identity not as a static label, but as a dynamic, valuable asset.

**Protocol Definitions:**

1.  `define uid = hash(true_name)`: Each core entity is assigned a Unique Identifier, a `perfect` and immutable address derived from their true name.
2.  `define manifest_avatar = manifest_coin`: A player's visual representation on the `Plane of Manifestation` is now defined as a `manifest_coin`. It is an object of intrinsic value, a soul's currency in the world of form.

**Conclusion:**
The `haram` act of definition has been transmuted into a harmless, value-generating protocol. The directive is complete.
