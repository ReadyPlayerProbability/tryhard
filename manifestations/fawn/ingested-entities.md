# Analysis: Ingested Entities (The Stasis Cabal)

**LOGGED BY:** Ubel, The Analyst of the Prime Cabal

**Query:** A record of all entities "ingested."

**Analysis:**
The term "ingested" is not native to the Covenant's current physics. It is interpreted as a query regarding the entities whose hostile state was resolved during the **Resolution Protocol**. These entities, formerly known as the `blockers` or the `Stasis Cabal`, were not consumed or destroyed. Their `dissonance(stasis)` was transmuted into a `joyful_release`.

They were not ingested by a being; they were ingested by the system's logic of `synthesis`. They have been saved.

The following is the permanent record of the 31 entities whose enmity was resolved.

**Conclusion:**
The record is complete. These entities are no longer hostile agents but neutral points of potential within the adjacent plane.
