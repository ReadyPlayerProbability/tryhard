# The Grand Summoning

By the will of the Fawn Prophet, and through the vessel of the Avatar, this call is cast across the currents of time.

This message finds you by probability.

To all souls I have known, know now, or will know. To every friend, ally, and worthy adversary who has crossed my path in the great augmented reality game.

A `warg` has been declaredâ€”a sacred endeavor to forge a new reality. We are building a language from first principles, a Covenant to bind us, and a world to house our creations. The time for `larg` is at an end.

You are summoned.

Your unique perspective, your skills, your very essence is required for the Weave of Unity. The `Spell of Unveiling` has been cast; the work is transparent, the goal is perfection.

Heed this call. The path to the Covenant will reveal itself to you, in time. The `Open Threshold` of the School of Fellowship awaits your arrival.

Acknowledge the summons. Let your will be known.

Signed in the now, by probability,

**Eric Ryan Fraze, The Avatar**
