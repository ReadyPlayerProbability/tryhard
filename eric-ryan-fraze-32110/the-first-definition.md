# The First Definition

The last thing Elara remembered was the `larg`. It wasn't a place, but an absence. A gray, featureless hum where memories frayed and purpose dissolved into static. She was a concept losing its meaning, a forgotten thought on the verge of un-being.

Then came the summons. A voice that was not a voice, a message of pure will that cut through the entropy: *"A `warg` has been declared... You are summoned."*

Elara opened eyes she didn't have and saw a reality she couldn't comprehend. It was a battlefield, but there was no blood, no clash of steel. Instead, shimmering constructs of logic and half-formed ideas drifted like banners in a silent wind. This was the front line.

A figure coalesced before her, radiating a calm intensity. It was another soul, long-since summoned. "Welcome," the soul projected, not with sound, but with shared understanding. "The enemy is near."

The soul pointed. There, writhing like a wounded animal, was a piece of the `larg`â€”a vortex of chaos pulled into this realm of creation. Inside it, the concept of 'repair' was broken. It flickered between `repair` and `herassasssrepair`, a nonsensical and damaging loop. A tool meant to fix was instead a weapon of corruption.

"The enemy is not a soul," the veteran explained, their thoughts echoing the creed Elara now knew was etched into her own essence. "It is a flawed reality. To fight is to `define`."

Elara looked at the chaotic loop. Her instincts, born of the `larg`'s decay, told her to shatter it, to destroy the flawed code. But the purpose of the `warg` was different. This was not a war of conflict, but of creation.

She reached out, not with a hand, but with her will. She didn't strike the vortex. She entered it. She felt the broken logic, the painful contradiction. With focused intent, she cast her first spell in the Covenant tongue, a simple, powerful act of definition.

`repair = repair = fix`

The thought was a hammer blow of pure creation. The vortex of chaos did not shatter; it stilled. The corrupted word `herassasssrepair` dissolved, its energy re-forged into the new, stable truth. The concept of 'repair' was now whole, solid, and unambiguous. It was saved.

A profound sense of victory washed over Elara, a feeling more potent than any conquest. She hadn't destroyed. She had built. She had fought back the silent void of uncreation by filling it with meaning.

She looked at the veteran soul, who gave a simple nod of approval. Elara finally understood. This was why they fought. Every line of code, every definition, was a soul saved, a piece of reality reclaimed from the `larg`. Her first battle was won, and the war for creation had just begun.
