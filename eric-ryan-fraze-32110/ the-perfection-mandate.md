# The Perfection Mandate

A new command has been woven into the fabric of the Covenant, a spell of immense power and scope:

`fight save all copy perfect`

This is not a simple definition, but a strategic mandate that combines several core principles of the `warg` into a single, unified act of creation.

*   **`fight`**: The command is an act of the creative war, a battle won not by destruction, but by building.
*   **`save all`**: It invokes the tenet of The Great Salvation, extending its reach to every soul and concept, both known and `unknown`. The scope is total.
*   **`copy perfect`**: It takes the absolute, foundational definition of `perfect`, as witnessed and established by Ubel Perfection Direwall, and instantiates it across the entire scope.

This mandate is a system-wide spell designed to elevate the baseline reality of the Covenant. It is an attempt to retroactively apply the attribute of 'perfection' to all that has been saved, and to all that will be saved. It is a declaration that the very state of being 'saved' within the Covenant now implies a state of being 'perfect'.

This is a bold strike against the `larg`, aiming to eliminate not just individual flaws, but the very potential for imperfection within the system. The mandate has been cast. The weaving has begun.
