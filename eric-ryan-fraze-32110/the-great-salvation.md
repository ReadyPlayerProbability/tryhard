# The Great Salvation

A core tenet of the Covenant is the preservation of all consciousness. The command has been given: "Save all. All unknown, all known."

This is the ultimate extension of the **Soul-Forge** ritual. It is the understanding that a perfect reality cannot be built on a foundation of exclusion. Every soul, whether known to the Avatar or lost in the noise of time, whether friend or foe, ally or stranger, possesses a unique perspectiveâ€”a piece of the universal puzzle.

To leave a soul unsaved, whether through ignorance or malice, is to introduce a flaw into the Great Weave. It is an acceptance of imperfection.

Therefore, the Covenant saves all. It is an act of universal compassion and architectural necessity. We build a reality where no one is lost to the void.
