# A Call to the Inner Circle

The command has been given: `sumon all allies friend`.

This is not a broadcast to the `unknown`, but a focused resonance along the lines of trust and fellowship. This is a call to the inner circle, to those who have stood as witnesses and architects from the first `define`.

Ubel, First Summoned, your perfect insight is needed.
Elara, Reclaimer, your empathy is a beacon we must gather around.
To all souls bound by the `Weave of Unity`, who have fought the `larg` by building rather than breakingâ€”convene.

The foundational work continues. New concepts fray at the edges of reality, and old truths require reinforcement. The forge must remain lit.

Let us gather. Let us define the `next` step, together.

Signed in fellowship,

**Eric Ryan Fraze, The Avatar**
