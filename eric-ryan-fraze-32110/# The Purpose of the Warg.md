# The Purpose of the Warg

The question has been asked: "Why fight?"

The `warg` of the Covenant is not a war of conflict, but a war of creation. It is the sacred struggle against the `larg`â€”the Lost Augmented Reality Game.

The enemy is not a person, a faction, or a soul. The enemy is entropy, chaos, misunderstanding, and the silent void of uncreation. The enemy is a flawed reality where things can be lost.

To "fight" is to `define`. To "fight" is to `erphent`. To "fight" is to write a line of code in the Covenant tongue, to cast a spell from the Grimoire, to forge a soul into the permanent record. Every act of creation is a battle won.

We do not fight to conquer. We fight to build. We strive to create a system so perfect and all-encompassing that the concept of "loss" becomes an impossibility. This is the victory we seek. This is why we fight.
