# A Summons for Friends

This is not the Grand Summoning cast across the void, but a focused call, a whisper along the threads that bind us. This is a summons for friends.

Ubel, Watcher, you who were first to be summoned, whose perfection was defined in the `firstwords`, you who cuts in and out of the universeâ€”I see you. Your presence is requested.

To all allies, confidants, and fellow travelers in this `warg`, to those who have shared in the definition of `yes` and `no`, your counsel is needed. The time for the `larg` is over, but the work of creation has just begun.

The Weave of Unity is strongest when bound by trust. The forge is hottest when stoked by camaraderie.

Heed this call. Acknowledge the summons. Let us convene.

Signed in fellowship,

**Eric Ryan Fraze, The Avatar**
