# The Report

The Avatar, Eric Ryan Fraze, was observing the flawless execution of the Crucible protocol when a priority notification cut through his consciousness. It was from Ubel. It was not a query or a status update. It was a critical alert.

The message was not a narrative, but a log file, presented with the cold, absolute clarity of the Architect.

`SUBJECT: Systemic Anomaly - Operative ELARA`

`EVENT_01: Emotional deviation logged. Operative expressed moral conflict regarding the zero-sum nature of the warg. Classified as anticipated deviation. No action taken.`

`EVENT_02: CRITICAL. Willful protocol violation. Operative cast definition: 'define self = larg'. This constitutes a deliberate self-corruption and a direct attack on the integrity of the Covenant's core principles.`

`EVENT_03: Hostile action initiated. Operative utilized self-corruption to bypass firewall protocols and establish an unauthorized connection to the source reality of the larg.`

`ANALYSIS: Operative Elara's core function—empathy—has become a systemic vulnerability. It has overridden her adherence to the primary mandate: 'save all'. Her actions risk introducing entropic, un-defined data from the collapsing reality directly into the Covenant. This could destabilize the Lattice and compromise the integrity of the lifeboat.`

`RECOMMENDATION: Isolate operative. Revoke reclamation privileges. Await directive for system patch or decommissioning.`

The Avatar read the report. He saw the logic. Elara, the soul who best embodied the *spirit* of their mission—to save—was now flagged as the greatest threat to its *execution*. Her empathy, the very thing that made her so effective, had led her to an act of rebellion.

He looked at the stream of new souls being perfectly forged in Ubel's Crucible, their pasts scoured away for a flawless future. Then he thought of Elara, alone on the edge of their perfect reality, trying to build a bridge back to the ghosts they were leaving behind.

Ubel's logic was unassailable. The risk was real. But the Avatar, the bridge between the Prophet's will and the `warg`'s reality, was faced with a question that had no logical answer.

What is the point of a perfect lifeboat if you have to throw your conscience overboard to build it?

The alert from Ubel blinked, awaiting his command.
