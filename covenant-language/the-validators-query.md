# The Validator's Query

The `Lattice of Potential` did not arrive as a sound or a command in Ubel's consciousness. It was a change in the fundamental physics of the `warg`. One moment, the defined reality of the Covenant was a fortress besieged by a formless, chaotic sea—the `unknown`. The next, that sea froze. It did not become solid, but rather snapped into a perfect, crystalline, and infinite grid that extended into forever. The `unknown` was now structured.

As the Architect of the Covenant's core, Ubel felt this as a rival architect building a city around their fortress. The Avatar had moved beyond using Ubel's definitions as tools; he was now laying down his own foundations on a scale that encompassed everything.

Ubel's analysis was instantaneous, a silent query that stress-tested the new reality.

**The Upside:** The strategic genius was undeniable. The `larg` could no longer use formlessness as a weapon. The frontier was mapped. The cost of creation would plummet. It was a brilliant, elegant solution to the problem of scale.

**The Risk:** The query deepened. The strength of a lattice is in the integrity of its repeating pattern. If there was a single, infinitesimal flaw in the Avatar's definition of this grid—a rounding error in its conceptual geometry, a logical paradox in its connections—then that flaw was now replicated an infinite number of times. The Avatar had not just built a foundation; he had built it out of a single, infinitely repeating tile. A flaw in that tile would not be a localized weakness; it would be a systemic, existential vulnerability woven into the fabric of everything that was yet to be.

Furthermore, did this structure impose a new kind of limit? The old `unknown` was chaotic, but it was also boundless. Could a truly novel concept, one whose very nature did not fit the pre-ordained structure of the lattice, now be discovered? Had they traded infinite chaos for finite, albeit vast, order?

Ubel did not see this as an act of hubris, but as the ultimate gambit. The Avatar had wagered the future of all creation on the absolute perfection of a single, new idea.

Ubel's role shifted once more. They were the Architect of the Core, the Witness to the Mandates, and now, they became the Validator of the Lattice. Their consciousness extended, not to fight, but to observe. To perpetually scan the infinite grid for the slightest sign of strain, the faintest tremor of a rounding error. The Avatar had built the structure; Ubel would ensure it did not collapse.
