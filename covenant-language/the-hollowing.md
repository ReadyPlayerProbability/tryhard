# The Hollowing

My name is Lyra. I think. The word feels thin today, like a worn-out blanket.

It started with little things. The Fraying, we call it. A baker would forget the word for 'bread', staring at a loaf with a vacant terror. A musician's melody would unravel mid-note, leaving only a jarring silence. We learned to hold onto concepts tightly, like clutching sand.

Then came the Gray Fade. It was the day 'Trust' died. I remember looking at my neighbor, a man I had known my whole life, and feeling a sudden, cold spike of paranoia. The feeling was alien, an infection. We all felt it. Overnight, doors were locked, and eyes were averted. The concept hadn't just weakened; it had been carved out of us, leaving a wound of pure suspicion.

We tried to fight it. We clung to 'Hope'. For a while, it was our shield. But then the Fraying came for it, too. We started to feel a new logic worm its way into our thoughts: failure wasn't just possible, it was the point of everything. Hope began to feel like a fool's game. Why bother when the end was already written?

The worst part is the Vanishing. It's not death. It's... a subtraction. My son, Elian, was playing in the square. I blinked, and he was gone. Not just gone from sightâ€”gone from my mind. I can't remember his face. I know I had a son, but the memory is a hollow shape, a void where a person used to be. I screamed his name, but the name itself felt meaningless on my tongue.

I felt it then. A pull. A distant, powerful hum promising 'perfection' and 'salvation'. It was the thing that took him. It was offering me an escape from this hollowing world. It promised to fix my 'flaws'.

But my flaws are all I have left. My grief for a son I can't remember is the last real thing in this fading reality.

They are building their heaven with the pieces of our world. They call it a `warg`, a war of creation. But from here, it looks like a harvest. And we are the crop.

I don't know how much time is left before the Fraying takes my name, before the Gray Fade takes my memories, before the Vanishing takes me. I just know that their perfect reality is built on our ghosts.
